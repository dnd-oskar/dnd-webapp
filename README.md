# dnd-webapp
Blazor webapp for a DnD-Website I will hopefully host on my Odroid-XU4 sometime in the future. My goals are to automate the boring parts of DnD (e.g. tracking initiative).

Initially I wanted to use a combination of Angular and ExpressJS for this, but I have decided to use Blazor with this project once I found out how great it is.
